# How to Use WindSLIC UEFI SLIC Injector to Activate Windows 7 on UEFI Systems
  
WindSLIC is a set of tools that can inject a SLIC (Software Licensing Description Table) into the EFI/UEFI firmware of your computer, allowing you to activate Windows 7 on systems that use the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI). This is similar to what Daz Loader does for BIOS systems, but works on UEFI/GPT partitioned systems as well.

In this article, we will show you how to use WindSLIC UEFI SLIC injector to activate Windows 7 on UEFI systems, using the following steps:
  
1. Download WindSLIC from [GitHub](https://github.com/AR1972/WindSLIC) [^1^]. You will need the WindSLIC\_EFI folder and the Installer\_EFI\_gui folder.
2. Copy the WindSLIC\_EFI folder to the EFI partition of your system. You can use a tool like [AOMEI Partition Assistant](https://www.diskpart.com/) to access the EFI partition.
3. Copy the Installer\_EFI\_gui folder to a USB drive formatted as FAT32.
4. Boot your system from the USB drive. You should see a graphical interface of WindSLIC installer.
5. Select your EFI partition and click Install. This will install the WindSLIC EFI application to your EFI partition and add a boot entry for it.
6. Reboot your system and select WindSLIC from the boot menu. This will launch the WindSLIC EFI application and inject a SLIC into your firmware.
7. Reboot your system again and install Windows 7 as usual. You can use an OEM SLP key and certificate for your system manufacturer to activate Windows 7. You can find them [here](https://forums.mydigitallife.net/threads/oem-slp-keys.57835/).

## Benefits of Activating Windows 7
  
Activating Windows 7 with a valid product key offers a number of benefits for users. Some of the benefits of activating Windows 7 include:

- Updates will be downloaded automatically. This ensures that your system is always up to date with the latest security patches and bug fixes.
- You will have access to all of the features within Windows 7. This includes features like Windows Aero, Windows Media Center, and touch-screen controls that are not available in non-activated versions.
- You can access media files. Non-activated versions of Windows 7 may restrict your ability to play certain media formats or use certain media applications.
- You can activate trial versions of Windows 7 into full versions for free via Microsoftâs assistive technologies activation site [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/accessibility/windows10upgrade). This is a loophole that allows users with disabilities to upgrade their Windows 7 systems to Windows 10 for free, even after the official free upgrade offer has ended.

By activating Windows 7, you can enjoy the full potential of your operating system and avoid any potential issues or limitations that may arise from using a non-activated version.
